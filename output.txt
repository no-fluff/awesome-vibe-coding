The issue is a proposal to add \"Claudable\" as a new agent interface to the awesome-vibe-coding repository.\n\nb. **Type of Request**: This is an implementation request - I need to analyze the submission, validate the information, categorize it correctly, and create a GitHub Pull Request to add the entry to `data.toml`.\n\nc. **Key Information**:\n   - Resource Name: Claudable\n   - GitHub repo: https://github.com/opactorai/Claudable  \n   - Website: Not provided (optional since GitHub repo is provided)\n   - Interface type: Web UI\n   - User marked as NOT the developer/maintainer\n   - Marked as open source\n   - Issue body appears incomplete - missing overview and notes sections\n\nd. **Main Tasks and Challenges**:\n   - Validate the GitHub repo URL accessibility\n   - Analyze the repository to auto-generate summary and detail description\n   - Categorize as \"Agent interface\" based on submission\n   - Check for duplicates in data.toml\n   - Add properly formatted TOML entry to data.toml\n   - Create GitHub Pull Request\n   - Challenge: The issue submission appears incomplete (empty overview section)\n\ne. **High-level Plan**:\n   1. Read current data.toml to understand structure and check for duplicates\n   2. Use WebFetch to analyze the GitHub repository \n   3. Auto-generate summary and detail based on repository analysis\n   4. Add entry to data.toml in the [[interfaces]] section\n   5. Commit and push changes\n   6. Create pull request\n   7.
